# Background Replacement Sample Input

This is a placeholder for the sample input image `input.jpg`.

In a real implementation, this would be a sample image file (e.g., a product photo or portrait) that demonstrates the background replacement service.

To add a real sample image:
1. Place a JPG image file here named `input.jpg`
2. Ensure it's a high-quality image suitable for background replacement
3. Update the documentation to reference the actual image

Example use cases:
- Product photography with cluttered background
- Portrait with distracting environment
- Object isolation for catalog purposes</content>
